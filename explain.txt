Explanation of the project:

Access calculation of airplanes, UAV's, drones and every air vehicle which have fixed path

We are taking into account:


-- NATURE --
1. sun placement
2. ground elevation


-- Demand --
3. requested azimuth
4. request elevation
5. request relevance (including hours etc)
6. requested area
7. requested GSD (resolution)

-- instrument --
8. camera capabilities (GSD, zoom etc)
9. activity window of the camera (when we can actually take images)

The instrument Aw will be represented as vector which contain objects which tell us:
1. coordinates - LAT, LONG
2. time
3. event (can we actually take image at this time) - not sure if this is needed.




PROJECT STRUCTURE

1. We will start by drawing actually a random vector which represent a path/aw
2.
